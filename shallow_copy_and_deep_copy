#shallow copy and deep copy~

While assigning value from one to copy to another:
shallow copy=> have the same value, pointing to the same address
deep copy=> have the same value but pointing to different address

 whether to use shallow copy or deep copy doesn't depend on time efficiency, space efficiency or the programming language, but which one is logically legit.
