ALU: Arithmetic/Logic Unit
PC: Program counter
USB: Universal Serial Bus

Buses carry words(4/8 bytes) between components.
System bus, Memory bus, I/O bus

I/O devices: keyboard + mouse (input); display (output); a disk drive for long-term storage of data and programs.
Each I/O device connects to the I/O bus by a controller or an adapter.

[controller et adapter]
controllers: are chip sets in the device itself or on the system’s main printed circuit board (motherboard);
adapter: a card that plugs into a slot on the motherboard

Controllers and adapters transfer info back n forth between the I/O bus and an I/O device.

Main memory contains a collection of Dynamic Random Access Memory chips.

CPU = PC + registers + processor + ALU
CPU can:
load   a byte/word main memory => a register
store   a register => a location in main memory
operate   ALU + registers
jump    a word  instruction => PC
